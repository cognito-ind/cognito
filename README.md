# Cognito

## Introduction
After a careful feasibility study of whether or not test automation can work for you, you've decided to go with the automated approach and already know the benefits of automation.

The next step is figuring out which tool or framework would be right for you.

There are several tools and frameworks to pick from depending on the type of application and technology involved, the skill set required for operating the framework, budget, etc.

Most frameworks or tools are suitable to test a certain type of modules and not would not support others.
What if you wanted to test several types of modules in a single continuous work-flow?

One way to achieve this would be to use a framework which could combine the abilities of many other frameworks and APIs and make them work as one. A framework like Cognito.

Cognito is a 'Hybrid Test Automation Framework' built in Java which provides means to automate complex work-flows and generate highly customizable test logs and reports.

A Hybrid Test Automation Framework is a combination of multiple frameworks and tools working in unison to run a complex testing work-flow, which would otherwise be difficult run with a only a single framework. Such an approach can leverage a framework's strengths and can compensate for it's shortcomings by means provided by another framework.

In addition to the conventional data driven tests, Cognito also supports "cognitive testing" which allow testers to design verifications based on application specific business rules.

Cognito supports integration with all Java frameworks and APIs which can in turn support a vast variety of modules for testing. 

Cognito is built as an extension to JUnit to run System, Regression and Integration** Tests on modules.
